<!-- HTML code for the web player -->

<!--
     note : unlike the rest of this app, this code is meant to be (ultimately) accessible only to the admin of the event 
     that means only one 'instance' of the player. The code isn't meant otherwise. 
     for instance the volume isn't a Meteor Collection, which means that when changing it, other (non existing :) players will not get noticed
     other than that, it is not a real problem. These control have not feedback, that's all.
