= Pick A Song =

An app to collaboratively manage your music playlist.

Think of a party where one guy is the self-claimed "Internet DJ".
This guy is sometimes quite annoying, right ?
Well after launching this app in the computer which plays the music,
everyone can add songs to the playlist from their smartphones \o/

At the stage of a working prototype, but it's easy to run :
- `git clone`
- `apt-get install vlc`
- run `meteor`

Here is (not quite yet) works :

- scan a QR Code to get to the front page
- find a song
- add to the playlist
- enjoy with your mates

== Installation ==

This is only to be done once .
Install VLC and meteorJS

== Configuration ==

Instructions to come - but first the feature will have to be developped



Let me know how it went !

== Developpers ==

You can think of this app as a frontend for VLC (for now).

Emphasis on simplicity of the code:
- carefully choosen dependencies
- simple approach whenever possible
- more like a proof of concept so far really
- feel free to hack on it !
