= Pick A Song =

A web app to collaboratively manage your music playlist.


Think of a party where anyone is in front of the computer
You can think of this app as a web frontend for VLC.

In the end, here is it how it would work :

- scan a QR Code to get to the front page
- find a song
- add to the playlist
- enjoy with your mates

Emphasis on simplicity of the code:
- carefully choosen dependencies
- simple approach whenever possible
- more like a proof of concept so far really
- feel free to hack on it !
