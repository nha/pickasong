= Pick A Song =

An app to collaboratively manage your music playlist.

Think of a party where one guy is the "Internet DJ".
This guy is sometimes quite annoying, right ?
Well after launching this app in the computer plays the music,
everyone can add songs to the playlist from their smartphones!

Here is how it works :

- scan a QR Code to get to the front page
- find a song
- add to the playlist
- enjoy with your mates

== Installation ==

This is only to be done once .


== Configuration ==

This has to be done for each party you throw :)

Let me know how it went !

== Developpers ==

You can think of this app as a frontend for VLC.

Emphasis on simplicity of the code:
- carefully choosen dependencies
- simple approach whenever possible
- more like a proof of concept so far really
- feel free to hack on it !
